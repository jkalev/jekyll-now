## Everyday rural America 
For years I have used my photographs to illustrate ideas—realization: major shortcoming linked to architectural training.
I've failed to listen to what images tell me and what I'm experiencing in the moment.  
I stepped back, tried to see what stands out to me, and noticed I do not take photographs of urban landscapes or cities. There is no interest in landmarks or things typically considered notable.
Instead I'm drawn to those out-of-the-way diners or country stores where human connection happens most—places where everyday memories occur repetitively.
Landscapes that form our identity. An aesthetic about connection, not politics or the unusual, the subtle, often overlooked physical places that bind us together as Americans.

Everyday rural America is what draws my attention.
They reveal an American landscape rich in character and relationships.
 
In the next few months, I will share a series of photographs from these places calling it my "Everyday Rural America" project and include when I can, a link to Google maps so anyone interested can stop and experience them if they are traveling through these areas.
