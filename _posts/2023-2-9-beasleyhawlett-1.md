## The Beasley Hawlett files 
# Part 1: #
I'll share a few thoughts on the Beasley Hawlett murders and the upcoming trial of Coley McCraney, now scheduled for April of 2023. This was an initial blog post that expanded into several posts on my old blog. I decided to combine the posts into one series and add recent photographs I’ve taken, notes and source documents from researching the case for several years. Hopefully it can be of help to those interested in the case or to who may ultimately solve it.

First I’m going to say up front I do not know who killed J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. To the best of my knowledge no one does except those involved. I have resisted having an opinion about this for years and tried to listen only to the evidence. Until lately.
What I can say, contrary to public opinion, Coley McCraney the man charged with the crimes,  may be guilty and I hope to explain why that is likely and illustrate other theories evidence supports.

My background for anyone questioning my interest in this case. Several years ago I worked as investigator assigned by the court on a capital murder case of a drug dealer named Willie Pugh in neighboring Barbour County, from where the girls were murdered. After completing the job I worked as an investigator for a police department. 
I'm not a person with a law enforcement background, experience or forensic training. I'm a rancher with a background in architecture and planning now retired and hold a passionate interest in photography. In regards to criminal investigations I'm interested in alternative ways to learn information from images and mapping. I own farms in the two adjacent counties where the murders took place and know many of the law enforcement officers involved.

During the Pugh case I interviewed the man who found the body of the victim. I tracked him to a payphone used in Ariton Alabama where he was observed making a call at the same time and number from where a tip giving the location of the body. This man a self described "psychic body finder" explained how deceased victims missing would lead him to locate them. I know that sounds crazy but here’s the thing, at that time he had found multiple bodies in areas previously been searched by law enforcement and dog teams. 
This man, I learned along with a female companion from Dothan, was searching along a bridge where he felt the gun used to kill Beasley and Hawlett might be. 
For the record I don’t believe the psychic stuff but I can’t explain how he found the bodies he did - but the fact he was now engaged in the Beasley Hamlet case, one the Alabama's most troubling cold cases, was disturbing. 
So I started asking questions in a personal capacity and reading what was publicly available about the murders of the two girls that occurred July 31 of 1999. Then I became really interested and started devoting time to researching the case.

Beginning in 2014 I met several law enforcement officers through the next several years who discussed the case privately. I learned from a mentor, retired homicide detective named Danny Carmichael from the Montgomery Police Department, to ask three questions - who had the motive, opportunity and ability. He told me to let a detailed timeline determine questions, resist forming an opinion and be suspicious of your own bias. And go down every rabbit hole regardless of how insignificant it seemed. You just never know he said, you might fond a rabbit.
Simple rules, hard to follow.

For several years I applied Mr. Carmichael's rules to the case. 
I've have spoken to over a hundred witnesses, photographed thousands of documents, and earned the trust of one of the victim's father, Lanier Beasley. Several other family members and current law enforcement officers have spoken to me off the record. 
I still cannot possibly get the loss this family has experienced and the agony of not knowing what happened to them for 23 years. So in the spirit of open source and transparency to those parties interested, here is what I know.
