The past 8 years I have been making photographs in a community in Alabama. The area along the edge of the black belt region and has a long history of violence and marginalization of the black community.
Traditional interpretations of this region focus on the past civil rights movment and ignore continued segregation and the role of physical form in reinforcing racism.

I worked as a mountain guide in the San Juan mountains in southwest Colorado and photographed the small community of Silverton for several years.
