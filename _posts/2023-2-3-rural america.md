## Everyday rural America 
For years I have used photographs to illustrate ideasâ€”realization: major shortcoming linked to architectural education.
I've failed to listen to what images tell me and what I'm experiencing in the moment.  
I stepped back, tried to see what stands out to me, and noticed I do not often take photographs of urban landscapes or cities. There is little interest in landmarks or things typically considered notable.
Instead I'm drawn to those out-of-the-way diners or country stores where human connection happens most. The places where everyday memories occur repetitively.
Cultural landscapes that form our identity. An aesthetic about connection, not politics or the fancy. These subtle, often overlooked physical places that bind us together as Americans.

Everyday rural America is what draws my attention.
They reveal an landscape rich in character and relationships.
 
In the next few months, I will share a series of photographs from these places calling it "Everyday Rural America" and include when I can, a link  a map so anyone interested can stop and experience them if they are traveling through these areas.
There wont be much commentary or description just the photographs. If you see something appealing then stop and visit. 
America has a lot wrong with it these days but maybe it's a good idea to celebrate these things about us that make us what we are and little out of the way places we never can seem to forget.
