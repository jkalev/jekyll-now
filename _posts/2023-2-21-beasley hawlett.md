## The Last hour
Recently I was allowed to review several hundred Ozark Police Department interviews with witnesses from the investigation into the murders of J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. I then photographed the places in Dale county where investigators believe they were the last hour before their death.
Included is a photo of the interviews identifying places with the names of witnesses redacted. 

 The trial for the man accused, Coley McCraney is scheduled for April 17th in Dale County Alabama. He will face the death penalty if convicted.

 These photographs are for our community in Dale, Houston and Henry counties that have followed this case for years and still have an emotional scar from this heinous crime two decades ago. 
 
What I do know from the witnesses and former suspects I've met is JB and Tracie were full of life and positive celebrating JB's 17th  birthday that evening. Both had plans for their lives and going to college as they entered their senior year.
Then someone chose to end their lives. 
Hopefully this trial will bring answers to why these two precious lives were lost.

In the course of taking these photograph I met with JB Beasley's father and one of the last entries in her diary reveals how she thought about love. So simple and powerful how she writes 
"fall in love easily, accept people the way they are" and to "stay in love longer".
I wish we all had the wisdom JB Beasley had when she was only 17.

For one glorious summer they were beautiful, wild and free. I think that's how they would want to be remembered.
