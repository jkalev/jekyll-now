<p style="color: grey; font-size: 15px;"> Swimming area victims discussed visiting a few hours before their murders</p>
## The Last hour
Recently I was allowed to review several hundred Ozark Police Department interviews with witnesses in the investigation into the murders of J.B. Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. I then photographed the places in Dale county where investigators believe they were the last hour before their death.
Included is a photograph of the interviews with their names redacted. 

 The trial for the man accused of the murders, Coley McCraney is scheduled for April 17th in Dale County. He will face the death penalty if convicted.
 Our community here in Dale, Houston and Henry counties still have an emotional scar from this heinous crime over two decades ago. 
 
What I know from the witnesses I've met is JB and Tracie were full of life, optimistic and positive celebrating JB's 17th birthday that evening. 
I met and became friends with one of the victim's father and an entry in her diary revealed how she thought about love. So beautiful how she says "fall in love easily, accept people the way they are" and ends with "stay in love longer".
I wish we all could remember what JB knew when she was only 16.

For one glorious summer they were beautiful, wild and free. I think that's how they would want to be remembered.
