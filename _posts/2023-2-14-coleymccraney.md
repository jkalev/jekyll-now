<p style="color: grey; font-size: 16px;">Tracie Hawlett and JB Beasley murdered in Ozark Alabama in 1999</p>
<br/><br/>
## New Witnesses Surface in Coley McCraney Trial

Two months from the trial of Coley McCraney, charged with the 1999 murders of JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett, three new witnesses have been discovered, potentially changing the outcome of the trial and questioning the original grand jury's indictment.

The information in the form of sworn statements given to police was previously not known by current investigators, shared with the grand jury nor turned over to the defense attorneys during the discovery process.

Defense attorneys Andrew Scarborough and David Harrison have been adamant McCraney cannot be placed with the victims at the time of death, nor can police produce a murder weapon or provide a motive for the murders. Most importantly they claim DNA recovered from JB Beasley was from a consensual encounter and lack any signs of sexual assault or rape proves there is reasonable doubt he committed the murders.

Former prosecutor, David Emory's counter argument, has been “the DNA places him with the girls the night their murdered, and he lied to the police about knowing them”.
"We think he's the guy and want to get him in front of a jury," Emory said in a phone interview.

Contrary to Emory's claim three overlooked witnesses indicate Coley McCraney may not have been with them at the time of death. This follows a pattern by the Dale County prosecutor's office similar to they recently were forced to drop charges against another man Carl Harris for murder.

According to multiple statements by former Chief Tony Spivey, the victims were lost and ended up in Ozark before calling home from a payphone at the Inland store, formerly the Big Little. 
However, multiple witnesses place Beasley and Hawlett at a party on Highway 36 in Dale county between the Echo and Ozark communities a short distance from the store. It questions whether Spivey was aware his officers had interviewed the witnesses. 

1999 records from South Central Bell pinpoint the girls used the payphone in Headland at 10:23 PM after driving to Ozark at 11:38 PM.

A witness previously overlooked by the prosecutor and employee of the store recalls giving change to one of the girls before the store closed at 11:PM. She made these statements to Ozark Police Investigator Steve Arrington and to Alabama Bureau of Investigations Agent Barry Tucker.
 She positively identified one of the girls in her statement and notes a police officer pulled into the lot where the girls were last seen as she and her husband were leaving.

The time she gave the change was noted to be 10:50 PM, just before she locked the door to close the store, which means the girls must have driven directly to the store from Headland as the driving time is approximately 34 minutes.

This leaves a time gap of approximately 40 minutes before Tracie Hawlett used the Ozark payphone at 11:38 PM to call her mother Carol Roberts and say they would miss their curfew.
What happened in the hour between they arrived at the store and they placed that call is critical in solving the murders and potentially proving McCraney’s innocence.

A second previously overlooked witness recalled meeting Tracie Hawlett the night of the murders after 11:PM at a party that is about 8 minute's drive from the store where the girls were last seen.
His description of Tracie matches her clothing exactly in the police report given by her mother. Upon close reading, the statement reveals there were two parties on highway 36 and identifies the location of a third party where people were camping at a nearby river. The fact there were two parties on the same rural road seemed to be missed by the investigators as they assumed the "highway 36 party" was one.
Tracie suggests after they leave that party they will go swimming at a third location near Brown's Crossroads where bridges cross the Choctawhatchee river and there is a popular gathering and swimming place.

I contacted a man named Neal Werner in Michigan that police had originally identified as a suspect. Werner stated he knew the girls and saw them at a party but was scared of the police to cooperate. He alleged the police tried to offer him a plea deal if he would falsely confess to the murders.

The witnesses give critical new details to the whereabouts of the girls the night of their murders and connections to the Ozark area not previously known.

What becomes unlikely is the two girls called home at 11:38 PM and then left to meet two boys they had been dating only 15 minutes away and would stop and have sex with a older black male they did not know while en-route. Neither girl had a background of such behavior which indicates McCraney likely had contact with Beasley earlier that evening at one of the parties on highway 36. And he could be the man that JB was with while multiple people at the party talked to Tracie Hawlett.

McCraney's wife testified in a recent hearing that she was with McCraney from the 12-12:30 AM timeframe forward that might until he left on a trucking route the next day when the girls were discovered. The time of death has been estimated to be from 12:30 - 2:00 AM. McCraney is unaccounted for between 10 and 12 which matches what Tracie Hawlett described at the party on highway 36.

Critical to the theory McCraney may be innocent is a witnesses coming forward previously unknown to the current police investigators. One identifying a white male at the victim’s car on Herring at the time of their death and another identifying a vehicle and partial plate number from Houston county of a white Ford truck seen at the scene of the crime.

Shortly after this statement was given Ozark Police arrested Johnny Barrentine for the crime and when charges were dropped several months later the lead was not followed up on.

Both of these statement taken by officer Steve Arrington appear unknown to the current police department’s investigators and were not turned over to McCraney's defense team in the discovery requests.
