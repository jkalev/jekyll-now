New years resolutions.

1. Listen to the Dead more. Here's my favorite, [Jack Straw Paris 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aICQdwvlwXU)
2. Kill my [web site](http://www.jonkalev.com) replace with code running on MIT's server, served locally on jekyll. Master terminal and Git it  up when i post.  Simple text and images with links, footnote stuff of interest to readers. If you are reading this its dead.

Realizations:                          

1) Technology makes life complicated creativity is lost and more time consumed.

2) Know more, need less. Repeat...know more, need less.

3) My strength (if I have one ) is the image,  so focus on the idea an image can tell more than any text could and distill interest to the visual.

4) Sell my camera gear, I love Fuji but return to the simplicity of Leica system. Fixed lens, optics that are the best made, editing to a minimum. No photoshop. Stay groudned in the basics, shoot in manual mode, understand aperture, exposure, and use [hyperfocal distance](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/calculating-hyperfocal-distance-in-photography?BI=19414&msclkid=53de2982346c14b1e7734a45ea85f3cb) frequently. 





This made me go back to the moment I got turned on to photography while studying architecture at Auburn University, where I had a professor named [Michael Robinson](https://cadc.auburn.edu/people/michael-robinson/).

He was the catalyst; the courses demanding, which sometimes made him unpopular with less dedicated students. He taught a series of seminars where he discussed cultural geographer J.B. Jackson which I still reread and study to this day. 
Michaels and walys his devil's advocate was Jack Wiliams who chaired my thesis committee was also a Harvard professor. Being at Auburn's graduate program in the school of architecture during this time was a rare moment. You had two former very well regarded scholars that had ended up at Auburn due to their connection to Sambo Mockbee.
Williams viewed the landscape thrpoigh a ever changing urbanism view conecntating how and why cities and urabn form had eveolved how it has and documentign it in a series of books.
Williams taught me how to learn, Robinson taught me how to question, and Mockbee how to see. It was a magical moment at Auburn that has not since been repeated. 

Jackson, who taught at Harvard, where Michael went and taught prior to coming to Auburn, focused on the American landscape after 1945. Contrary to how architectural history was studied previously, focusing on style and form, he examined larger patterns of settlement that differed across America's landscapes. His essays read more like short stories and travelogues with simple ink sketches.  In doing so he connected he illusive idea of place and posited the ideas of how place informed form not the previous direction of form and human ideas creating place. Thus the landscape was ever changing and a quiltwork of influences.

One of my former job, an alpine guide, was in places like the image below. Above the treeline in a alpine tundra, no cell service and every view a postcard. I convinced myself to leave the mountains and use my education to have a "real job". 

Mistake in many ways but it led to a series of events that put me where I am. Now I have time to study these landscapes and document them getting at the illusice word we call "Place" that Jackson studied.

I hope all those interested will follow along.
