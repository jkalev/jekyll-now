New year and resolutions.

1. Listen to the Dead more. Here's my favorite, [Jack Straw Paris 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aICQdwvlwXU)
2. Kill my [web site](http://www.jonkalev.com) replace with code running on MIT's server, served locally on jekyll. Master terminal and Git it  up when i post.  Simple text and images with links, footnote stuff of interest to readers.

Realization:  a) Technology makes life complicated creativity is lost and more time consumed.

​                       b) Know more, need less. Repeat...know more, need less.

2- Sell camera gear, love Fuji but return to the simplicity of Leica. Fixed lens, optics as good as they can be made, editing to a minimum. No photoshop. The basics, shoot in manual mode, understand aperture, exposure and use [hyperfocal distance](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/calculating-hyperfocal-distance-in-photography?BI=19414&msclkid=53de2982346c14b1e7734a45ea85f3cb) frequently. 

My former job, an alpine guide was in places like the image below. Above the treeline in a alpine tundra ecosystem where there was no cell service and every view a postcard. I convinced myself to leave the moutians and use my education to have a "real job". MIstake in many ways but it led to a series of events that put me where I am.

In these conditions you can't review images as you take them in your viewfinder. One wrong step a times and your in serious trouble, you take the photos, stay safe and that evening look through your shots. 

Overtime you develop a gut feel for what your camera setting should be in any light condition.

This made me go back to the moment I got turned on to photography. While in architecture shcool at Auburn University I had a professor named [Michael Robinson](https://cadc.auburn.edu/people/michael-robinson/).

MIcahel was not easyhis courses difficult which at times made him unpopular with less than dedicated students. He had a series of seminars where he discussed cultural geographer  J.B. Jackson that I still reread and study to this day. 

Jackson who taught at Harvard, where Michael went and taught prior to Auburn, focused on the American landscape after 1945 and contrary to how architectural history was written previously focusing on building styles and form, he examined larger patterns of settlement differed across a myriad of landscapes. His essays read more like short stoies and travelogues with simple powerful ink sketches. 

Jackson wrote about trailer parks, clusters of dwellings in pueblos of the southwest and painted a picture of the American landscape with complex cultural and historical influences thaty greeted the land and adapted. This was a break from how America viewed itself which was tied to paintings and the romantic ideals of people like Jefferson who even after the civil war we saw ourselves and recreating a version of what was percived to be best in Europe. 

What struck me reading Jackson is how Europe who we sought to copy was formed on paths then roads from Romans and was so very different from a contine nt settled by rail and then a explosive growth post world war two by car. Where I spent time livijg in the small community of Montivialle in northern Italy roads were things that connected places and were curved around them and in many cases replicated trailsthosuands of years old. Moving to the American south in my high school years I met a landscape that was detemrined by roads and automobile. Cities, buildings and commercial centers were determined by where the highways went. In architecture programs which is where I ended up after a few false starts and following the Dead this was met with disdain. Conventional wisdom in acdemia was that old andonded towns should be revitalized, suburbs sprawling out were bad and strip malls cancerous blights on the landscape. The reality is when I got through my education and internship - designs skills were mostly used by those that could afofrd them, not mainstream America. Jackson helped me se that there were two Americas. In places like Alabama there were the Clios and Lousivilles and then the Fairhopes.  The have and have nots ideology vividly expressed in built form.

Jackson embraced how change occurred, embracing a car created landscape and the strip. 

I have sought increasingly to document this with my camera and sketchbook. This blog hopefully will be a more detemined chronicel of that journey.

I hope all those interested will follow along.
