Resolutions


1. Listen to the Dead more. Here's my fav, [Jack Straw Paris 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aICQdwvlwXU)
2. Kill my [web site](http://www.jonkalev.com) replace with code running on MIT's server, served on jekyll. Master terminal and Git it  up when I post.  Simple text and images, links, footnote sources . If you are reading this its dead.
3. Technology makes my life complicated creativity is lost and more time consumed. Reclaim that time and use it to focus on photography. Explore what they mean and how they can contrtibute to what we know.
4. Know more, need less, repeat...<u>know more, need less</u>.
5. My strength (if I have one) is images,  so focus on the meaning of an image.  
6. distill interests.
7. sell camera gear! I love Fuji but return to the simplicity of Leica. Fixed lens, optics that are the best made, editing to a minimum. No photoshop. Stay grounded in basics, shoot manual, understand aperture, exposure, and use [hyperfocal distance](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/calculating-hyperfocal-distance-in-photography?BI=19414&msclkid=53de2982346c14b1e7734a45ea85f3cb) . 



This made me go back to when I got turned on to photography while studying architecture at Auburn University, I had a professor named [Michael Robinson](https://cadc.auburn.edu/people/michael-robinson/).

He was the catalyst; the courses demanding, which sometimes made him unpopular with less dedicated students. He taught a series of graduate seminars where he discussed cultural geographer J.B. Jackson which I still reread and study to this day. 
Michael's devil's advocate was Jack Wiliams who chaired my thesis committee was also a former Harvard grad and professor. Being at Auburn's graduate program in the school of architecture during this time was a rare moment. You had two former well regarded scholars that ended up at Auburn due to their connection to Sambo Mockbee. It escapes the recoginiton of the faculty to this day that Auburn itself could not have gotten them to come there. The depth of Mockbee Willaims and Robinson has not been repeated by the program since.
Williams views landscape through an ever changing urbanism view documenting how and why cities and their urban form evolve in a series of books (see links below).
Williams taught me how to learn, Robinson taught me how to question, and Mockbee how to see. 

JB Jackson, who taught at Harvard focused on the American landscape post 1945. Contrary to how architectural history was studied previously, focused on style and form, he examined larger patterns of settlement that differed across America's landscapes. Discussing trailer parks, strip malls and interstate exits, his essays read more like short stories and travelogues with simple explanatory ink sketches.  

He connected the idea of place and shared ideas of how place informed form not the previous direction of form and human ideas creating a place. The landscape was ever changing and a quiltwork of influences we often choose to ignore.

My medium is image and sketch and one of my former jobs, an alpine guide, was in places like the images below. Above the treeline im alpine tundra, no cell service this required you understand light and how to use a camera in challenging weather conditions. This meant manual mode shooting and understanding exposure and aperture. 

For some reason I convinced myself to leave these mountains and use my education to have a "real job" as a city and county planner for Wyoming. Big mistake in many ways but this led to a series of events that put me where I am which enables me to study photography and document place.  

Below are a few pics from where I lived most of my adult life and worked as guide in Silverton Colorado. I miss these mountains  every day, minute, and second of my life. 

Below is a link to one of my favorite places to pitch my tent and spend nights cooking and drinking with Basque sheepherders beneath [Canby Mountain @ 37째48'04째N 108째32'51째W](https://earth.google.com/web/search/Silverton,+CO/@37.79825199,-107.54478646,4002.35611218a,2036.1061194d,35y,144.01108402h,44.98622742t,0r/data=CmcaPRI3CiUweDg3M2VlZjE0MThlMDI4MTU6MHhhOWRkNmI5OTdiYzg4YmU4Kg5DYW5ieQpNb3VudGFpbhgCIAEiJgokCSiQloTE00VAEYkW0xkRDDhAGbTYmb3rkFPAIVOAZTmAB1_A)

Hopefully one day soon I will get to return mountains.
In the mean time I'm going to learn to use my camera better and take a few snapshots along the way.

I hope all those interested will follow along, feel free to contact me via the email link above. And happy new years !
