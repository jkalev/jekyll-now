Resolutions.

1. Listen to the Dead more. Here's my fav, [Jack Straw Paris 72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aICQdwvlwXU)
2. Kill my [web site](http://www.jonkalev.com) replace with code running on MIT's server, served local on jekyll. Master terminal and Git it  up when i post.  Simple text and images, links, footnote sources and linksn of  interest to readers. If you are reading this its dead.

Realizations:                          

1) Technology makes life complicated creativity is lost and more time consumed. Recliam that time focus it on photography.

2) Know more, need less. Repeat...<u>know more, need less</u>.

3) My strength (if I have one ) is images,  so focus on the idea an image can tell more than any text could and distill interests.

4) Sell my camera gear, I love Fuji but return to the simplicity of Leica system. Fixed lens, optics that are the best made, editing to a minimum. No photoshop. Stay groudned in the basics, shoot in manual mode, understand aperture, exposure, and use [hyperfocal distance](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/tips-and-solutions/calculating-hyperfocal-distance-in-photography?BI=19414&msclkid=53de2982346c14b1e7734a45ea85f3cb) often. 



This made me go back to the moment I got turned on to photography while studying architecture at Auburn University, I had a professor named [Michael Robinson](https://cadc.auburn.edu/people/michael-robinson/).

He was the catalyst; the courses demanding, which sometimes made him unpopular with less dedicated students. He taught a demanding series of graduate seminars where he discussed cultural geographer J.B. Jackson which I still reread and study to this day. 
Michael's devil's advocate was Jack Wiliams who chaired my thesis committee was also a Harvard professor. Being at Auburn's graduate program in the school of architecture during this time was a rare moment. You had two former well regarded scholars that ended up at Auburn due to their connection to Sambo Mockbee. It escapes the recoginiton of the faculty that Auburn itself could not have gotten them to come there.
Williams viewed the landscape through an ever changing urbanism view documenting how and why cities and urban form evolved in a series of books (see links below).
Williams taught me how to learn, Robinson taught me how to question, and Mockbee how to see. It was a moment at Auburn that has not since been repeated. 

Jackson, who taught at Harvard, where Michael taught prior to coming to Auburn, focused on the American landscape post 1945. Contrary to how architectural history was studied previously, focusing on style and form, he examined larger patterns of settlement that differed across America's landscapes. His essays read more like short stories and travelogues with simple explanatory ink sketches.  He connected the idea of place and posited ideas of how place informed form not the previous direction of form and human ideas creating a place. Thus the landscape was ever changing and a quiltwork of influences.

One of my former jobs, an alpine guide, was in places like the image I took below. Above the treeline in a alpine tundra, no cell service this ofrcd me to udnerstand light and how to use a camera in insane weather conditions. This required manual mode shooting and a understandign of exposure and aperture. For some reason I convinced myself to leave these mountains and use my education to have a "real job". Big mistake in many ways but it led to a series of events that put me where I am which affords me to study photogrpahy and use it to document place.  

I hope all those interested will follow along and feel free to comment or contact me via the email link above.
