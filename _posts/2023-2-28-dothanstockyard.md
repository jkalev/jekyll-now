<p style="color: grey; font-size: 16px;">Dothan, Alabama</p>

This crowd is a little sensitive about being photographed with activists out there but here is one of my calves that sold yesterday. Watching the sale what hit me is there are generations of experience accumulated in a sale barn to make a it happen. This really isn't something technology or time can change. From vets to order buyers and the ranchers selling their cattle. 
I used to have the job the young man has in the cowboy hat 40 years ago. Not a thing has changed and it felt like going back in time. I heard Dr Perry yelling in the background, he worked the sales when I was there and hes now in his seventies. The only thing different is I looked over to where my Grandfather always sat and he was gone. I sure miss him. The calves brought a good price, I think he would have been proud.
