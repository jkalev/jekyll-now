         <p style="color: grey; font-size: 24px;text-align: center; font-family:Avenir;"> A HORSE NAMED HELLBOY</p>

In 2016  two Mormon brothers and an armed group of citizens seized a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon. Much of my family is Mormon and for generations have raised cattle. A news agency asked me if I would go photograph the protest. So in the middle of winter I loaded up my dog and camera and drove across the country to find the Bundy brothers and meet a Mormon Bishop and rancher named Lavoy Finnicum.

        In Jan. 2016 an armed Mormon group seized a wildlife refuge in rural Oregon. Much of my family is Mormon and for generations raised cattle. A producer at a news agency pointed out to me and asked if I would go photography it. So without much thought and little to do in the winter except put out hay, I loaded up my dog and camera and off I went across the country to find Burns Oregon.
