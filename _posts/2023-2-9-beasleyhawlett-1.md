## The Beasley Hawlett Files: Part 1
I'll share a few thoughts on the Beasley Hawlett murders and the upcoming trial of Coley McCraney, now scheduled for April 2023. This was an initial blog post that expanded into several. I combined the posts into a four-part series for Medium and added photographs I've taken, notes, and source documents. This series is aimed at the local community of south Alabama, where many have followed this case for years. At a community level, it has left a deep emotional scar that has fueled conspiracy theories and undermined confidence in law enforcement. Above all, it has remained unsolved for over twenty years.

I do not know who killed JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. To the best of my knowledge, no one does except those involved. This will not be a whodunnit, just sharing what I've learned about the case after years of research.
Contrary to public opinion, Coley McCraney may be guilty, and I hope to explain why this is possible and illustrate other theories evidence supports. 
The question the jury will have is going to be one of reasonable doubt. This percentage is a roll of the dice; it may be 80% or 90%. This is important because, in this case, unlike most homicides, there is no murder weapon, the police cannot put McCraney at the scene of the crime, and no one has been able to prove a motive for the murders. My prediction is the trial will come down to what percentage of reasonable doubt is held by a jury given the DNA puts him with the girls in a time thats close to when they were killed and if it's enough to acquit or be a hung jury. 
It is a long two months between now and the trial, so this could change in an instant if just one person in Dale county decides to come forward.
It is not my place to out or pressure them and I will not betray their confidence. I believe the current Ozark police chief Charles Ward is a decent and competent man. For anyone fearing coming forward he alone is who they should go to and request protection.

A brief background for anyone questioning my interest in this case. 
Several years ago, I worked as an investigator assigned by the court to the murder of a local drug dealer named Willie Pugh in neighboring Barbour County, Alabama. After completing this job, I worked as an investigator for a police department until my chief resigned. 
I'm not a person with a law enforcement background or forensic training. I'm a passionate photographer with an interest in investigations and alternative ways to learn visually. This is a large part of my interest in this case. Additionally, I own farms in the adjacent counties where the murders occurred, raise cattle, and know many law enforcement officers involved.

Strangely a self-described "psychic body finder" is who led me to have a interest in the Beasley Hawlett case. During the Pugh case, I interviewed the man who found the body of the victim. I tracked him to a payphone used in Ariton, Alabama, where he was observed making a call with a tip on the location of the body. This man explained how deceased victims missing would lead him to find their corpses. I know that sounds crazy, but here's the problem, he's found multiple bodies in areas previously searched by law enforcement and dog teams. This man, I learned, along with a female companion from Dothan, was actively searching under bridges in Dale county where he "felt" the gun used to kill Beasley and Hawlett was. These two self described "crime sleuths" were working with a half sister of one the victim's. The woman involved was an informant for the state's cold case unit and was being handled by state cold case investigator Shawn Smith.

For the record, I don't believe the psychic stuff, but I can't explain how he found the bodies, so the fact he was now engaged in the Beasley Hamlet case was disturbing. I started asking questions in a personal capacity and reading what was publicly available about the murders of the two girls on July 31, 1999.
The Ozark Police department, as well as the State Bureau of Investigations (formerly Alabama Bureau of Investigations), have spent an enormous amount of resources the past two decades and could not solve it.

<p style="color: grey; font-size: 16px;">Coley McCraney</p>

Coley McCraney, if guilty, was never on their radar and left the area the next day on a long-haul trucking route. All these years, when they got close to a suspect they believed was involved, DNA testing compared semen recovered from one of the victims didn't match. 

Part of that blame lies squarely on Coley McCraney.
I am going to point out the obvious, this is a man who is a preacher and co-founder of a church, and when detained by Ozark Police, claimed he did not know the girls. So lets dispel any notion that this a honest man. 
We know from semen recovered from J.B. Beasley's body this is a lie.
So from the start this man is a liar, but that does not make him a murderer.

Coley McCraney, if he is innocent, had sex with a 16-year-old girl in the last hour of her life that was brutally murdered. This guy then got into a truck and drove away from Alabama the next morning. There is no way that he did not know these girls were murdered and left in a trunk a short distance from his house later that day - assuming he's innocent. Instead of stopping his truck, contacting the police, and telling them everything he knew that could have helped solve the crimes, he kept driving across the country.

Why? Maybe as a black man in the white-dominated court and police force of Ozark, Alabama, in 1999, he feared he would be blamed for the murders. I can understand that, but he got the opportunity to live his life, create a family and start a church. JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett never got this chance. Their lives ended that night before it ever really got started. If you assume he is innocent, he could more than anyone else have helped determine who murdered them.
But he chose silence.

McCraney should say everything he knows and remembers about that night, no exception. What he should have done then but can do now - if he is a man of faith and innocent, is start talking. I am going to be candid; instead, he is hiding behind a defense lawyer and lying to the police about knowing them.
I think this has to be said before a lawyer or prosecutor opens their mouth to spin a conspiracy theory or a judge lectures the community about the presumption of innocence. Let's make no mistake; this is where we are with Mr. McCraney. He is a liar and has refused to share information to help solve two brutal murders. 

After becoming interested in the case due to the psychic body finder's involvement, I met several law enforcement officers over the next several years who discussed the case privately. I learned from a retired homicide detective named Danny Carmichael (Montgomery Police Department) to ask three questions, motive, opportunity, and ability. He told me to develop a detailed timeline and let it determine questions. Resist forming an opinion and be suspicious of your own bias. Simple rules, hard to follow.

Much of the information in this case is in the form of witness statements. Outside of the DNA, which indicates only that McCraney had some type of consensual sexual encounter, the autopsy noted there were no signs of sexual assault.
This makes pay phone records, security video at the convenience store where they were last seen, and witness statements critical.

Former secret service agent and US Marshal Mark McClish developed a technique termed "statement analysis" that measures the reliability of a witness's statements.

"When a truthful person describes a past event, he is relying upon his memory as he tells the story. It will be like a parade passing in front of him, and he will state in sequential order everything that is occurring. He should be speaking from the perspective as if he were reliving the event." <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

When speaking with people I've interviewed and reviewing statements taken by the police in the weeks following the murders, I've learned not to assume anything. We can only choose to believe what people tell us. I have spoken to over a hundred witnesses, reviewed nearly ten thousand documents, and earned the trust of one of the victim's fathers, Lanier Beasley. Several other family members and current law enforcement officers have spoken to me off the record. In all these interactions I have followed McClish's advice and learned if you want to detect deception analyze people's language very carefully. Their words will betray them. How a person phrases his or her statement will also share information they do not want you to know.

In dealing with deceptive people, many, police officers tied to this case, I've asked myself how I would have phrased that statement, and this has helped me see what the person is really saying. Hopefully, what I can share will help resolve this case, and if Coley McCraney is guilty, help law enforcement identify a potential accomplice.
