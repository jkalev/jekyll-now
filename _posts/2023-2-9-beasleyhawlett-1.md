## The Beasley Hawlett Files: part 1
I'll share a few thoughts on the Beasley Hawlett murders and the upcoming trial of Coley McCraney, now scheduled for April 2023. This was an initial blog post that expanded into several. I combined the posts into a four-part series for Medium and added photographs I've taken, notes, and source documents. This series is aimed at the local community of south Alabama, where many have followed this case for years. At a community level, it has left a deep emotional scar that has fueled conspiracy theories and undermined confidence in our law enforcement. Above all, it has remained unsolved for over twenty years.

First, I'm going to say up front I do not know who killed JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett. To the best of my knowledge, no one does except those involved. This will not be a whodunnit, just me sharing everything I know about the case after years of research.
Contrary to public opinion, I can say that Coley McCraney may be guilty, and I hope to explain why that is possible and illustrate other theories evidence could support. The question a jury will have in the courtroom is going to be reasonable doubt. This is a percentage that with every jury is a roll of the dice; it may be 80% or 90%, depending on its makeup. This is especially important because, in this case, unlike most, there is no murder weapon, the Ozark Police department cannot put McCraney at the scene of the crime, and no one to date has been able to prove the motive for the murders. My prediction is this trial will come down to what percentage of reasonable doubt is held by the jury and if it's enough to avoid a guilty verdict. It is a long two months between now and the trial, so this could change in an instant if just one person in Dale county decides to come forward.

A brief background for anyone questioning my interest in  this case. 

Several years ago, I worked as an investigator assigned by the court to the murder of a local drug dealer named Willie Pugh in neighboring Barbour County, Alabama. After completing the job, I worked as an investigator for a police department. 
I'm not a person with a law enforcement background or forensic training. I'm a photographer with an analytical interest in investigations and alternative ways to learn visually. This is a large part of what interests me about this case. Additionally, I own farms in the adjacent counties where the murders occurred, raise cattle, and know many law enforcement officers involved.

A self-described "psychic body finder" led me to research the Beasley Hawlett case. During the Pugh case, I interviewed the man who found the body of the victim. I tracked him to a payphone used in Ariton, Alabama, where he was observed making a call and giving a tip on the location of the body. This man explained how deceased victims missing would lead him to find them. I know that sounds crazy, but here's the thing, he's found multiple bodies in areas previously been searched by law enforcement and dog teams. This man, I learned, along with a female companion from Dothan, was actively searching under bridges in dale county where he "felt" the gun used to kill Beasley and Hawlett had been discarded. These two "crime sleuths" were working with a member of one of the victim's family. The woman involved was an informant for the state's cold case unit and was being handled by state investigator Shawn Smith.

For the record, I don't believe the psychic stuff, but I can't explain how he found the bodies, so the fact he was now engaged in the Beasley Hamlet case was disturbing. I started asking questions in a personal capacity and reading what was publicly available about the murders of the two girls on July 31, 1999.

This case is complex, and the Ozark Police department, as well as the State Bureau of Investigations (formerly Alabama Bureau of Investigations), have spent an enormous amount of resources over the past two decades and could not solve it.

<p style="color: grey; font-size: 16px;">Coley McCraney</p>

Coley McCraney, if he is guilty, was never on their radar and left the area the next day on a long-haul trucking route. All these years, when they got close to a suspect they believed was involved, DNA testing compared to the semen recovered from one of the victims didn't match. Part of that blame lies squarely on Coley McCraney.
I am going to say the obvious, this is a man who is a preacher and co-founder of a church, and when detained by Ozark Police, claimed he did not know the girls.
We know from semen recovered from J.B. Beasley's body this is a lie.
So let's put the fact on the table from the start this man is a liar, but that does not make him a murderer.

Coley McCraney, if he is innocent, had sex with a 16-year-old girl in the last hour of her life that was then brutally murdered. This guy then got into a truck and drove away from Alabama the next morning. There is no way that he did not know these girls were murdered and left in a trunk a short distance from his house later that day - assuming he's innocent. Instead of stopping his truck, turning around and contacting the police, and telling them everything he knew that could have helped solve the crimes, he kept driving away from Ozark across the country.
Why? Maybe as a black man in the white-dominated court and the police force of Ozark, Alabama, in 1999, he feared he would be blamed. I can understand that, but he got the opportunity to live his life, create a family and start a church. JB Beasley and Tracie Hawlett never got this chance. Their lives ended that night before it ever really got started. If you assume he is innocent, he could have helped determine who murdered them.

McCraney should say everything he knows and remembers about that night, period, no exception. What he should have done then but can do now - if he truly is a man of faith, is start talking. I am going to be candid; instead, he is hiding behind defense lawyers and lying to the police about knowing them.
I think this has to be said before a defense lawyer or prosecutor opens their mouth to spin a conspiracy theory or a judge lectures the community about the presumption of innocence. Let's make no mistake; this is where we are with Mr. McCraney. He is a liar and has refused to share information that could help solve these brutal murders. 

After becoming interested in this case due to the psychic body finder's involvement, I met several law enforcement officers over the next several years who discussed the case privately. I learned from a retired homicide detective named Danny Carmichael (Montgomery Police Department) three questions, motive, opportunity, and ability is what to ask. He told me to develop a detailed timeline and let it determine questions. Resist forming an opinion and be suspicious of your own bias. Simple rules, hard to follow.

Much of the known information, in this case, is in the form of witness statements. Outside of the DNA, which indicates only that McCraney had some type of consensual sexual encounter, the autopsy noted there were no signs of sexual assault.
This makes pay phone records, security video at the convenience store where they were last seen, and witness statements critical.

Former secret service agent and US Marshal Mark McClish developed a technique termed "statement analysis" that measures the reliability of a witness's statements.

"When a truthful person describes a past event, he is relying upon his memory as he tells the story. It will be like a parade passing in front of him, and he will state in sequential order everything that is occurring. He should be speaking from the perspective as if he were reliving the event." <a id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>

When speaking with people I've interviewed and reviewing statements taken by the police in the weeks following the murders, I've learned not to assume anything. We can only choose to believe what people tell us. I have spoken to over a hundred witnesses, reviewed nearly ten thousand documents, and earned the trust of one of the victim's fathers, Lanier Beasley. Several other family members and current law enforcement officers have spoken to me off the record. In all these interactions have followed McClish's advice and learned if you want to detect deception, then analyze people's language very carefully. Their words will betray them. How a person phrases his or her statement will also share information they do not want you to know.

In dealing with deceptive people, many police officers tied to this case, I've asked myself how I would have phrased that statement, and this has helped me see what the person is really saying. Hopefully, what I can share can help resolve this case, and if Coley McCraney is guilty, help law enforcement identify a potential accomplice.
